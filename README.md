# rcate-BugTracker is a fully functional program that keeps track of software or hardware related issue.  

Administrators and Project Managers create projects and assign a team of Developers and Submitters.
Submitters create tickets for each project and Project Managers assigned Developers to a ticket.
Developers view each ticket and change the status of the ticket depending on where they are on it.
